# hello-world1
My first Repository (not even knowing what I am doing) as a start with GitHub.  Hope to solve this mystery soon :)   
I am married, father of 3 children, and I currently work for a pharmaceutical company.   My passion for being a developper has grown to the point that I am now a student in a Computer Programming program.  I take my classes after work.  I do work 40 hours a week, so one can imagine how challenging it is to study while working full time.  I don't get discouraged nor complain about my situation right now because I know it's for a good cause.  At the end of it I will have accomplished something I am proud of.  Something that makes me feel that I have realized one of my long waited for desires.   And I will be able to work in the field while bettering my knowledge in the industry.   I also am interested in appling what I have learned to help other people and organizations...
